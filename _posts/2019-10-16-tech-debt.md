Tech Debt:
Doing something quickly then properly.

Types:
1. Code Debt: 1 hr of written code => 10 hrs of reading code
a. Complicated Code: large classes, long methods, logic with complicated expression, several level of identation, cryptic names, no comments or worthless comments. Wrtting code for developers not for computer. WRITE clean code.

a. CUT and PASTE coding: code smell
b. Tight coupling
Warning Sign: large time to get the code which need top change, tight coupling

2. architectural debt
Lack of the design. Requirements are going to change over the time. Not possible to anticipate the future features. Initial architecture mnot going to be perfect, it should be flexible.

a. Missing Layer: Do not combine layers. eg : presentation + bussiness in the same layer. => Big ball of mud.
b. Missing extensibility Points: to allow new feature to plug in easily. OPEN and CLOSE principle.
c. Overlooked Concerns: security, scalability, performance.
Warning Sign:  saying can't be done, hacking new feature-in, CUSTOMER wont notice.

3. Knowledge Debt

4. Test Debt:
a. not thorough test cases.
b. 100% unit test 
c. TDD: Test: write failing unit test case first, Code: write enough code that make the test pass. => Refactoring

5. Technological Debt:
