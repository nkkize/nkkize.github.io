# Tech Debt
The basic definition of the tech debt coudl be as simple as doing something quickly then properly.

# Types:
## Code Debt
1 hr of written code is 10 hrs of reading code. Code debt can be categorized into below broader categories:

- Complicated Code
    - large classes
    - long methods
    - logic with complicated expression
    - several level of identation
    - cryptic names
    - no comments or worthless comments
    - Solution:
        - Wrtting code for developers not for computer.
        - WRITE clean code.

- CUT and PASTE coding
    - code smell
- Tight coupling between components
    - hard to change relationships

> Warning Sign: large time to get the code which need top change, tight coupling

## Architectural Debt
Signs to identify architectural debt  
- Lack of the design
- Requirements are going to change over the time
- Not possible to anticipate the future features
- Solution  
    - Initial architecture not going to be perfect, it should be flexible.
    - Missing Layer: Do not combine layers. eg : presentation + bussiness in the same layer.
    - Missing extensibility Points: to allow new feature to plug in easily. OPEN and CLOSE principle.
    - Overlooked Concerns: security, scalability, performance.

> Warning Sign:  saying can't be done, hacking new feature-in, CUSTOMER wont notice.

## Knowledge Debt
Todo

## Test Debt
Signs to identify test debts
- not thorough test cases.
- not well written unit test, missing coverage
- Solution
    - Follow TDD approach
    - Write failing unit test case first
    - Code write enough code that make the test pass
